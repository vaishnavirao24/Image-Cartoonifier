# 🖼️ Image Cartoonifier  

A Python-based application that transforms images into a cartoon-style version using **OpenCV** and **NumPy**. The project applies edge detection and bilateral filtering techniques to give a smooth, animated effect to any image.  


## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Converts images into cartoon-like visuals  
✔️ Simple GUI for easy user interaction (Tkinter & EasyGUI)  
✔️ Uses **OpenCV** for edge detection and smoothing  
✔️ Fast and lightweight processing  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** OpenCV, NumPy, ImageIO, Matplotlib, Pillow, Tkinter, EasyGUI  

## 📥 Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image-Cartoonifier.git
   cd Image-Cartoonifier
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   python cartoonifier.py
   ```

## 📝 How It Works  
1. The user selects an image through the GUI.  
2. OpenCV applies bilateral filtering for smoothing while preserving edges.  
3. Edge detection is performed to outline objects in the image.  
4. The final cartoonized image is displayed and saved.
